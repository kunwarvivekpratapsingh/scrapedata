Core Components

Data Flow

Technology Stack Choices

Interaction Flows (End-to-End)

1. 🧩 Core Components
📦 Backend Services
Service	Responsibility
Model Service	Trains and serves the ML model to generate fraud rules
Rules API	Serves ML-generated and user-defined rules via REST API
Backtest Engine	Runs custom/user rules on historical data
Rules Engine	Executes rules in production on incoming transactions
User Management	Auth, RBAC (roles), logging actions
Job Scheduler	Periodic model retraining and rule refresh jobs
💾 Databases
DB	Purpose
Transactions DB (OLAP)	Stores historical and real-time transactions (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake)
Rules DB	Stores ML-generated rules, user-defined rules, rule run history (PostgreSQL or MongoDB)
Model Store	Stores trained model artifacts (MLflow, S3, GCS)
Metadata DB	Stores audit logs, user actions, API logs, model versioning (PostgreSQL, Redis for caching)
🎨 Frontend (Web App)
Built using React.js or Next.js

Components:

Dashboard of generated rules

Rule builder (UI to create rule conditions)

Backtest results view

Transaction history and fraud flags

Model explainability (SHAP or tree paths)

2. 🔄 End-to-End Data Flow
⚙️ (A) Training + Rule Generation (Offline Pipeline)
Historical data pulled from Transactions DB

Feature engineering pipeline built (user behavior, device, etc.)

ML model training (RandomForest, XGBoost, or Interpretable models)

Rule Extraction:

From model: via Decision Trees, SHAP explanations, or path pruning

Rules stored in Rules DB with metadata

Model artifact saved in Model Store

👨‍💻 (B) UI Interactions
User logs in → Auth service returns JWT + profile

Calls /rules/ml → gets latest ML-generated rules

User builds rule in Rule Builder UI (e.g., amount > ₹10k AND country != India)

Calls /rules/backtest → backend queries Transactions DB with dynamic filter

Backtest engine returns:

Matched transaction count

Fraud ratio (if is_fraud column exists)

Downloadable sample

User saves rule → stored in Rules DB

(Optional) User deploys rule → it becomes part of production Rules Engine

🚦 (C) Real-time Transaction Flow
Incoming transaction hits /transaction/check

Backend:

Extracts features

Sends features to Model Service → gets fraud score

Evaluates Rules Engine → if rule match or model score > threshold → action

Decision (allow/flag/block) sent to transaction system

3. 🚀 Technology Stack Suggestions
Layer	Tech Choices
Frontend	React + Tailwind + Chart.js / SHAP.js for explainability
Backend APIs	FastAPI or Node.js (for Rule, Auth, Backtest APIs)
Model Service	Python with FastAPI + scikit-learn/XGBoost + MLflow for tracking
Model Training	Jupyter / Prefect / Airflow pipelines (triggered daily)
Database	PostgreSQL (rules + user data), BigQuery or Snowflake (transaction data), Redis (caching)
Rule Execution	Durable Rules (Python), Drools (Java) or custom filter parser
Infra	Docker + Kubernetes + CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
Monitoring	Prometheus + Grafana, ELK stack for logs, Sentry for errors
Auth	Auth0 or OAuth2 with JWTs

🧠 Key Design Considerations
Topic	Recommendation
Explainability	Use SHAP for feature-level insight per transaction
Model Retraining	Triggered via scheduler, logs drift metrics
Rule Priority	Apply user rules before model rules (or vice versa based on config)
Auditability	Track who created rules, when, and what changed
Scalability	Use BigQuery/Snowflake for massive historical data
Security	Encrypt transactions and logs, role-based access on rules
✅ TL;DR: What You’re Delivering
A full-stack fraud analytics platform that:

Learns fraud rules from ML models

Shows those rules with explainability

Lets users define and test custom rules

Supports real-time and batch execution

Scales with modern, cloud-native components
